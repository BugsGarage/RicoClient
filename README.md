# Rico Client
Client for the Collectible Card Game (codename "Rico") on Unity. 

### Current status
In work. First prototype ready. 

You could find the built versions of the client [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16AVvpvVjpbGJE3PrKkzGofX082TuqeDk/view?usp=sharing) (for Windows) and [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tdSUI1GlrVZ3mg7m3g05djqJqJeWztQI/view?usp=sharing) (for Linux).

### Current gameplay
* Opponents take turns and try to destroy the enemyâ€™s base;
* Cards are divided into three types: units (can attack, apply abilities), buildings (generate resources, cannot attack), spells (one-time abilities);
* Bases also have the number of generating resources;
* The drawing of each card costs a certain number of resources;
* Resources are accumulated and accrued at the beginning of every turn.
